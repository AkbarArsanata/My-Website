    longDescription: "The Univariate Automation Analysis project is a comprehensive tool designed to automate and simplify the analysis of univariate time series data, offering seven key features: Overview for quick data summaries and visualizations, Decomposition to break down trends, seasonality, and residuals, Feature Importance to rank influential time-based variables, Forecasting with automated models like ARIMA and Prophet, Anomalies Detection to identify outliers, Clustering to group similar patterns, and Calendar Analysis to assess time-based effects like holidays or weekly trends. This solution is ideal for data professionals seeking an efficient, all-in-one approach to explore, predict, and derive actionable insights from time series data without extensive manual effort.",
